---

TinyRocket has been updated to use Astro 2.0.13 with minimal changes.
For now, I have not moved the blog pages to "content collections" yet.

Version 0.9.9 has been tagged in the source code repo. If someone wants
to use TinyRocket for Astro 1.x series, v0.9.9 or below is the version to
use. Version 0.9.10 is the first version to use Astro 2.x series.

Have a nice day.
